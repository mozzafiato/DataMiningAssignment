1. compute D
2. compute W
3. compute eigenvalues
4. compute eigenvectors for (D-W)*y = l_2*D*y, where
   * l_2 is second smallest eigenvalue
5. cut the graph by sign values of y
6. ncut-value: The normalized cut size is the cut size times the sum of the reciprocal sizes of the volumes of the two sets.
